Stopwatch and Countdown Timer
This project is a simple web application that provides two functionalities: a stopwatch and a countdown timer. The user can select either of these options from the main screen.

Stopwatch
The stopwatch can be started, paused, and reset. The time is displayed in the format HH:MM:SS. The stopwatch keeps track of the time even when the user navigates away from the page.

Countdown Timer
The countdown timer allows the user to set a specific amount of time, and then it counts down to zero. The user can pause and resume the countdown, and reset it back to the original time. The countdown timer also displays the remaining time in the format HH:MM:SS.

Implementation
The application is implemented in JavaScript, with event listeners attached to the different buttons to handle user interactions. The time tracking is done using JavaScript's setInterval function, which calls a function every specified number of milliseconds.

The application's UI is dynamically updated using JavaScript's innerHTML property to change the HTML content of the selected elements.

Usage
To use the application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can then select either the stopwatch or the countdown timer from the main screen.
